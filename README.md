# TOBA-Modelling

This repository contains code used for data analysis and modelling an optical lever attached to a torsion pendulum. This model is used for predicting noise and signals obtained from TOBA.

Details-
1. Lagrangian.py - Model the dynamics of an asymmetric torsion pendulum
2. calculateQ.py - Analyze the data obtained to calculate Q(Quality Factor)
3. getReflectionX - Get the form of the signal obtained if the mirror is attached at the x-axis
4. getReflectionY - Get the form of the signal obtained if the mirror is attached at the y-axis

Rest are helper functions.
