# TOBA-Modelling

This repository contains code used for data analysis and modelling an optical lever attached to a torsion pendulum. This model is used for predicting noise and signals obtained from TOBA.

Details-
1. Lagrangian.py - Model the dynamics of an asymmetric torsion pendulum
2. calculateQ.py - Analyze the data obtained to calculate Q(Quality Factor)
3. getReflectionY - Get the signal obtained from the optical lever

Rest are helper functions.
